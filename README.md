# Simple Printf Program in C

This is a basic implementation of the `printf` function in C, which includes support for binary conversion and the basic format specifiers. This program is designed to be educational and serve as a starting point for understanding how `printf` works under the hood.

## Features

- Support for `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, and `%b` format specifiers.
- Binary conversion for integers using `%b`.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/printf.git
   ```

2. Compile the program:

   ```
   gcc *.c -o _printf
   ```

## Usage

You can use this `_printf` implementation in your C programs by including the `main.h` file in your project and calling the `_printf` function just like you would with the standard `printf` function.

```c
#include "main.h"

int main() {
    int num = 42;
    char str[] = "Hello, World!";
    _printf("Integer: %d\nString: %s\nBinary: %b\n", num, str, num);
    return 0;
}
```

## Format Specifiers

- `%d`: Format specifier for integers.
- `%s`: Format specifier for strings.
- `%c`: Format specifier for characters.
- `%b`: Format specifier for binary conversion of integers.
